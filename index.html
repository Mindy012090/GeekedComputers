        frame. If more resources are required or the time frame changes, we will notify

<h3>We Repair Apple Products!</h3>
<p>
    Many computer repair shops either repair windows or repair apple; at Geeked Computers, 
    we have tied the knot with this dilemma and can repair both. So you can come to us with 
    all your computer needs! We work on Mac desktops, MacBooks, and Ipads. 
</p>

<h3>Upgrades</h3>
<p>
    Technology is forever changing, making it difficult for your system to have some of the latest 
    technology. Now you donâ€™t have to buy new, just bring your current desktop or laptop in, and we 
    can see what types of upgrades we can do on your system to having it working at full capacity 
    and running similar to newer devices.
